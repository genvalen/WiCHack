    -

3. Constellation Brands

    - website
    - app

      Wegmans API and give potential points earned)

## Idea

1. Create an app that can scan barcodes of items at Wegmans and show current points
2. Barcodes get the money spent total by user. Every x dollars spent => money donated
3. Recommended recipe based on foods bought
4. Also have a website that users can see recently bought items + how many dollars have been donated.
5. App has a grocery list
